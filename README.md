# Ant Colony Optimization
This is a final project for a computational methods course at the University
of Maryland.
<br><br>
The project is an implementation and example use of the *Ant Colony Optimation*
algorithm. The algorithm attempts to find an approximate solution to the 
Traveling Salesman Problem in polynomial time.

A full explanation and citations are available in the [pdf report](Ant_Colony_Optimization.pdf).
